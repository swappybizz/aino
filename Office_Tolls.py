        - ### 1.Click on < sidebar button to reveal the options.
        - ### 2. Select Smei ( Smithy in Norwegian) to enter the workspace. This Workplace is Where you create, modify, retire and manage your agents.

                            #### In case of quitionaers, specialised enquiries etc, a detailed set of instructions including contingency plans for the agent, must be included in the instructions.
                            #### In most cases its also recommended to give the agent a set of documents as knowledge base to refer to. but is optional. The same information can be added in instructions as well, but the file upload is just for your convenience.
                - #### d. Input type: The type of input the agent will accept. Will it just chat? or accept documents as well? Define what the input must consist of?
                - #### e. Output type: The type of output the agent will provide. Will it just chat? or provide documents and /or files as well?
                
        - Once the agent is live you can see it in the active agents list, and control or modify
        
        ### What happends when the agent can not answer the client's query?
        - ### The agent will ask you for the answer, and you can provide the answer dieectly to the client, add to client-bot chat, as well as make it public knowledge (at clients permission ofcourse) to demonstrate your speciality.
        - ### You can optionally add the query and answer to the agents knowledge base for future reference. So you :red[Never have to answer the same thing twice].
